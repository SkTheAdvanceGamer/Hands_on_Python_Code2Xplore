📖 About This Repository

This repository is a personal workspace created for completing Python Daily Challenges under the Hands-on Python program.

Each challenge focuses on applying Python concepts through practical problem statements.
The goal is to build consistency, improve logical thinking, and gain confidence in writing clean Python code.

🗓 Daily Challenge Workflow

One Python problem is assigned each day

Each solution is submitted as a separate .py file

File names clearly indicate the challenge day and problem theme

🔹 Examples

FirstDay.py – Introductory Python basics

day_2_smartid_credential_validator.py – Validation logic using conditions

Day_3_Student_performance_Analyzer.py – Student marks analysis using loops and lists

Day_4_Smart_List_Filter_&_Rebuilder.py – Filtering and rebuilding lists using data type checks and conditional logic

This structure will be followed for all upcoming challenges.

🧩 Concepts Practiced

Through these challenges, the following Python concepts are practiced regularly:

User input and output

Conditional decision-making

Iterative logic using loops

Lists and string handling

Basic error and value validation

Real-world inspired problem solving

Data type identification and list manipulation

▶️ Running the Programs

To execute any challenge:

Ensure Python is installed on your system

Open a terminal in the project folder

Run the required file using:

python Day_4_Smart_List_Filter_&_Rebuilder.py


Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal
