# Hands_on_Python_Code2Xplore 🐍

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository is a personal workspace created for completing **Python Daily Challenges** under the *Hands-on Python* program.

Each challenge focuses on applying Python concepts through practical problem statements.  
The goal is to build consistency, improve logical thinking, and gain confidence in writing clean Python code.

---

## 🗓 Daily Challenge Workflow
- One Python problem is assigned **each day**
- Each solution is submitted as a **separate `.py` file**
- File names clearly indicate the challenge day and problem theme

### Examples
- `FirstDay.py` – Introductory Python basics  
- `day_2_smartid_credential_validator.py` – Validation logic using conditions  
- `Day_3_Student_performance_Analyzer.py` – Student marks analysis using loops and lists  

This structure will be followed for all upcoming challenges.

---

## 🧩 Concepts Practiced
Through these challenges, the following Python concepts are practiced regularly:
- User input and output
- Conditional decision-making
- Iterative logic using loops
- Lists and string handling
- Basic error and value validation
- Real-world inspired problem solving

---

## ▶️ Running the Programs
To execute any challenge:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run the required file using:
Day_3_Student_performance_Analyzer.py
4. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal
