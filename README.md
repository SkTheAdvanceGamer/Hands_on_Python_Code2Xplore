🐍 Hands_on_Python_Code2Xplore

A structured collection of daily Python challenges completed as part of the Hands-on Python learning program.

📖 About This Repository

This repository documents my daily progress in solving Python challenges designed to strengthen core programming skills.

Each challenge focuses on applying Python concepts to practical problem statements. The aim is to build consistency, improve logical thinking, and gain confidence in writing clean and structured Python code.

🗓️ Daily Challenge Structure

✔ One problem solved each day
✔ Each solution stored as a separate .py file
✔ File names clearly represent the challenge day and topic
✔ Gradual increase in difficulty and logic-building

📂 Completed Challenges
Day	File Name	Description
Day 1	FirstDay.py	Introduction to basic Python syntax
Day 2	day_2_smartid_credential_validator.py	Input validation using conditional logic
Day 3	Day_3_Student_performance_Analyzer.py	Student marks analysis using loops and lists
Day 4	Day_4_Smart_List_Filter_&_Rebuilder.py	Filtering and rebuilding lists based on data types and conditions
Day 5	day_5.py	Smart Transport Load Balancing System
Day 6	Day_6_Smart_Playlist_Intelligence_System.py	Playlist validation and analysis system
📌 Day 5 Mandatory Details

L value: 7

PLI value: 1

Applied rule: Rule B (Remove all Very Light items from the final plan)

📌 Day 6 Highlights

The Smart Playlist Intelligence System performs:

Validation of song durations

Detection of invalid inputs

Total playlist duration calculation

Duplicate duration checking

Balance comparison between first half and second half

Categorization of playlist as:

Too short

Too long

Repetitive

Balanced

Irregular

It also generates recommendations based on playlist structure.

🧠 Concepts Practiced

Through these exercises, I regularly practice:

User input and output handling

Conditional statements (if-else)

Loops (for, while)

Lists and basic data analysis

Logical validation

Structured problem-solving

▶️ How to Run the Programs

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SkTheAdvanceGamer/Hands_on_Python_Code2Xplore.git

Navigate into the project folder:

cd Hands_on_Python_Code2Xplore

Run any file using:

python filename.py

Example:

python Day_6_Smart_Playlist_Intelligence_System.py

More challenges will be added consistently as part of continuous learning.
