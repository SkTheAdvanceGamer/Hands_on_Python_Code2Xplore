# 🐍 Hands_on_Python_Code2Xplore

A structured collection of daily Python challenges completed as part of the Hands-on Python learning program.

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my daily progress in solving Python challenges designed to strengthen core programming skills.
Each challenge focuses on applying Python concepts to practical problem statements.
The aim is to build consistency, enhance logical thinking, and gain confidence in writing clean, structured Python code.

## 🗓️ Daily Challenge Structure
* ✔ One problem solved each day
* ✔ Each solution stored as a separate `.py` file
* ✔ File names clearly represent the challenge day and topic
* ✔ Gradual increase in difficulty and logic-building

## 📂 Completed Challenges

| Day | File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Day 1 | `FirstDay.py` | Introduction to basic Python syntax |
| Day 2 | `day_2_smartid_credential_validator.py` | Input validation using conditional logic |
| Day 3 | `Day_3_Student_performance_Analyzer.py` | Student marks analysis using loops and lists |
| Day 4 | `Day_4_Smart_List_Filter_&_Rebuilder.py` | Filtering and rebuilding lists based on data types and conditional logic |
| Day 5 | `day_5.py` | Smart Transport Load Balancing System |

### 📌 Day 5 Mandatory Details:
* **L value:** 7
* **PLI value:** 1
* **Applied rule:** Rule B (Remove all Very Light items from the final plan)

*More challenges will be added consistently.*

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
Through these exercises, I regularly practice:
* User input and output handling
* Conditional statements (`if`-`else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Lists and string manipulation
* Data type checking
* Basic validation logic
* Problem-solving using structured thinking
